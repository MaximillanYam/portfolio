# portfolio

I had intended to create a personal portfolio using javascript, html, css but had quickly found that I struggled very hard to design anything properly using css. I was much more comfortable programming with python, later on I had learned of different libraries (Rio and Reflex) that promised a "python" only front-end development. I had quickly grown very interested and decided to learn Reflex to create my portfolio.
