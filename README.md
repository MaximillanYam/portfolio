# portfolio

This project utilizes the RIO library in python to create my portfolio webstite. I struggle to work with css ... Which is why I have put off front end development for a long time. I had learned about different libraries that could solve this and had narrowed down my choices to Reflex and Rio. I had discovered that Reflex still requires you to design your components using css-like structure, so I opted for Rio which is suppose to be more "pythonic".
